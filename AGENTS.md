## Resume Builder Repo – Session Notes (Codex)

This file records what was built/changed so far for the resume-builder repo. Read first.

---

## 1. Current Architecture (Resume Builder)

- Resume Builder mini-app baseline aligned to Ansiversa standards.
- Auth handled by parent app JWT; middleware enforces auth.
- Shared layouts: `AppShell.astro` and `AppAdminShell.astro`.
- Notification unread count fetched in AppShell via parent API (SSR).
- One global Alpine store per app pattern.
 - Includes Example Items CRUD (user + admin) and a minimal baseline landing.

---

## 2. Example Module (Deletable)

Example Items module is used to demonstrate CRUD + admin patterns:

- Module root: `src/modules/example-items/`
- Routes:
  - `/items`
  - `/items/[id]`
  - `/admin/items`

Delete this module and the routes when starting a real app.

---

## 3. DB Tables

Defined in `db/tables.ts`:

- `ExampleItem`

---

## 4. Resume Templates

- Templates are provided by `@ansiversa/components` via `ResumeBuilderShell`.
- Preview route: `/dev/resume-preview` (`src/pages/dev/resume-preview.astro`).

To add a 5th template later:

1) Add the new template type + renderer in `@ansiversa/components`.
2) Extend the `types` array in `src/pages/dev/resume-preview.astro`.
3) Ensure any new data requirements are covered by `resumeData`.
